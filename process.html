        <p>I thought long and hard about what I wanted my thesis to be centred around. When i went back to india for my winter break I constantly was thinking about what should my thesis revolve around. While at home, I could not help but retrospect how my first semester abroad was.</p>
        <p>When i moved to US, I wanted to embrace the awkward. Be the first one to initiate conversations. Try to fully take in the experience of living in a different country and stepping out of my comfort zone.</p>
        <p>This constant evolution was uncomfortable but rewarding. I found a community of amazing friends and colleagues in my school. I felt at home with my friends I had made and that gave me a sense of safety.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When i was thinking about it at home I kept seeing how much i had changed in the short amount of time I had been in school.</p>
        <p>I constantly kept asking myself that was I loosing my true essence in order to camouflage around people and the conclusion i came to was that I did not have to hold onto my "tru self" as such.</p>
        <p>I am constantly evolving and to thrive I need to shed my old skin to become a new.</p>
        <p>This revelation became the core of my installation.</p>

        <p>This project was done as a thesis for my graphic design grad program. we had ~4 months to come up with a personal topic, research, come up with design implementation to communicate the topic , build, and then install for viewers.</p>
        <p>My classmates chose topics from all across the fields, somebody made a sculpture of their tooth to convey the story of their tooth pain, one of my classmates made pottery for a fictional design retreat and things like that.</p>

        <p>Calculated camouflages, the title stems from the fact that we as humans constantly present doifferent versions of our selves in different environments, but that doesnt mean that we are a different person.</p>

        <p>once i saw the space, i started scoping it out.</p>
        <p>i thought of putting a centre attraction at the end of the room and have body tracking wall projections on both sides of the wall.</p>
        <p>I would do this by mounting cameras to the wall at eye level and attach projectors on the opposite side in the cieling.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>i talked to my advisor Daniel and Morgan, on what projectors and drilling resources we had on camopus to make my life easier.</p>
        <p>I also calculated how big the projections would be and once i had my size estimations i got to designing the visuals for the centre screen.</p>
