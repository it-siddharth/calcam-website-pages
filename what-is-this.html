          <p>This project was my thesis for a graphic design MFA. We had four months to pick a personal topic, research it, build it, and install it.</p>
          <p>I spent a lot of that time thinking about my first year in the US. Moving here, I had pushed myself to embrace discomfort. Initiating conversations, stepping outside my comfort zone, becoming someone new in order to find community. It worked. I found amazing friends and felt genuinely at home.</p>
      </div>
      
        <div class="text-block text-block-2">
          <p>But I also noticed how much I had changed. I kept asking myself whether I was losing my true self by adapting so much to different people and environments. The more I sat with this question, the more I realized I was thinking about it wrong. I don't need to hold onto a fixed "true self." I'm constantly evolving, shedding old versions to become new ones. That's not losing myself. That's being myself.</p>
          <p>This became the core of my installation. The title "Calculated Camouflage" comes from this idea. We present different versions of ourselves in different environments, but that doesn't make us fake. We are our choices and whatever we make of them.</p>

        <p>Once I had the core idea, I needed to figure out how to communicate it visually. I started with philosophy, and Søren Kierkegaard's writing gave me the anchor I needed. He describes the self not as something you have, but as something you continuously create through your choices.</p>
        <p>For visual direction, I looked at camouflage in nature, X-rays, and thermal scans. Images where solid things become see-through, where what's hidden becomes visible. I also studied new media artists working with room-scale interactive installations since I had never built anything like this before. Their work helped me understand how to think about the viewer's body moving through a space.</p>

        <p>Once I saw the gallery, I started planning how the experience would unfold. I wanted a central focal point at the far end of the room with body-tracking projections on both side walls. Visitors would be surrounded by responsive imagery as they moved toward the centerpiece.</p>
        <p>I talked with my advisors about what equipment was available on campus, calculated projection sizes based on throw distances, and figured out camera placements. The technical setup started to take shape: cameras at eye level, projectors mounted to the ceiling on opposite walls.</p>
