        <p>This project was my thesis for a graphic design MFA. We had four months to pick a personal topic, research it, build it, and install it.</p>
        <p>For my theme, I spent a lot of time thinking about my first year in the US. Moving here, I had pushed myself to embrace discomfort. Initiating conversations, stepping outside my comfort zone, becoming someone new in order to find community. It worked. I found amazing friends and felt genuinely at home.</p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="backstory-header">between who i am and who i could be, lies an ocean of <em>maybes</em></h3>
      <div class="backstory-text">
        <p>But I also noticed how much I had changed. I kept asking myself whether I was losing my true self by adapting so much to different people and environments. The more I sat with this question, the more I realized I was thinking about it wrong. I don't need to hold onto a fixed "true self." I'm constantly evolving, shedding old versions to become new ones. That's not losing myself. That's being myself.</p>
        <p>This became the core of my installation. The title "Calculated Camouflage" comes from this idea. We present different versions of ourselves in different environments, but that doesn't make us fake. We are our choices and whatever we make of them.</p>

        <p>Once I saw the gallery, I started planning how the experience would unfold. I wanted a central focal point at the far end of the room with body-tracking projections on both side walls. Visitors would be surrounded by responsive imagery as they moved toward the centerpiece.</p>
        <p>I talked with my advisors about what equipment was available on campus, calculated projection sizes based on throw distances, and figured out camera placements. The technical setup started to take shape: cameras at eye level, projectors mounted to the ceiling on opposite walls.</p>

      <p class="centrepiece-text">After experimenting with a gazillion text options and sentences, I found "You are your choices" to be the most true to what I wanted my piece to say. For me this sentence embodied everything I wanted to communicate to the viewer. I feel that this is the crux of human identity and in the end we are not bound by anything except what we want ourselves to be. Our choices shape what we are and its only in retrospect that we can see how they've defined us.</p>

      <p class="centrepiece-text">My advisor suggested colored acrylic sheets. Panels that block certain light wavelengths and filter what you see. The idea clicked immediately. To get the full picture, viewers would have to look through these colored windows. It worked both ways: practically, the acrylics filtered the RGB display. Conceptually, you need to look through different lenses to see the whole truth.</p>

      <p class="reflections-text">Having always designed on a screen, it was wild to see my work come alive in something bigger than a 32 inch monitor. I was overwhelmed with emotions when I saw people coming in and playing with the camera projections. People dancing, kids trying to touch their projections on the wall, one person crying. Seeing people react the way they did was eye-opening. It made me feel I could do so much more with the skills I have. It made me realise that design and art have the power to pull people out of their lives and mental state. If I could create work that makes people pause from their day to day lives and have a moment to themselves, that would be a great goal to accomplish.</p>
